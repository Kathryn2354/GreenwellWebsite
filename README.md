# COSC401MajorProject201920
This system was created by the Fall 2019 COSC 401 Software Startup Simulator Capstone class to create Greenwell State Park’s database. This system will be an internet hosted database used by board members and trustees of the Greenwell Foundation. The intended use of this database is to replace their current content distribution and organization system with a centralized, proprietary solution.
